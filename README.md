# Large-Font Pedometer
Developed for a client with a vision impairment who cannot use conventional pedometers.

This wrist-worn pedometer provides a large and bright display combined with clear tones when buttons are pressed and goals are met. The user can set a step goal and the pedometer will play a tune once the goal is reached.

Code written in Circuit Python to be used with the [Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit).
