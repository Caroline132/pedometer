# Large-Font Pedometer
Developed for the GNG 2101 course for a client with a vision impairment who cannot use conventional pedometers.

This wrist-worn pedometer provides a large and bright display combined with clear tones when buttons are pressed and goals are met. The user can set a step goal and the pedometer will play a tune once the goal is reached.
